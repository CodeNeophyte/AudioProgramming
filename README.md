## Ideas/Interests
1. algorithmic/generative music (in addition: processes that ‘tracks’ parameters) 
2. build interactive synthesis objects that allows OS to control sound parameters dynamically
3. Start several distinct music processes that respond to actions upon particular game objects/user interactions 

## Focus areas/Goals for music technology (taken from Calarts website)
The Music Technology program aims to built strong musical skills while promoting the mastery of a variety of music-related technologies in the context of pursuing creative work. Specifically, Music Technology students will have opportunities to:

* become trained musicians able to work in a variety of musical ensembles and global music productions, with appropriate competencies in music theory and musicianship skills, while emphasizing the specialties of 21st Century music technology;
* develop professional-level skills allowing them to produce concerts, stage-manage, understand sound mixing and diffusion, and run stage monitoring and main audience sound;
* become skilled in and know how to run music studios at a high level for album and media production, including microphone techniques, software editors, audio effects, mixing, mastering, and the use of the Internet for audio production;
* develop thorough historical knowledge of electro-acoustic music as well as knowledge of the theory and operation of algorithms for traditional synthesis and audio effects production;
* become software engineers able to write computer code for websites for the Internet and understand advanced object-oriented computer languages for artistic expression;
* learn to design and build basic electronic circuits and make human computer interface designs for artistic practices;
* acquire knowledge of basic digital signal processing and how it relates to audio, including time and frequency domain processing and how these may be manipulated for artistic practices;
* develop high-level practical and professional skills, including the ability to synthesize diverse studies, project planning, execution, time management, and documentation of both technical and musical work at a level suitable for publication in a professional journal.
